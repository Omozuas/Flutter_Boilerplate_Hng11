## API Integration
This boilerplate is designed to integrate seamlessly with our backend APIs. The services layer (lib/services/) handles all API requests, using Dio for HTTP client functionalities. Endpoints and request parameters should be configured in the service classes.


## Theming
The UI is designed to match the style of our existing [boilerplates](https://kimiko-csharp.teams.hng.tech/). The theme can be customized by modifying the (lib/ui/utils/) directory. All colors, fonts, and styles are centralized for easy customization.
